# Personal Calendar web part

This web part provides you the ability to add a particular user's personal calendar on a web page. The web part may be configured to automatically refresh, as well as display up to seven days of events and a pre-defined number of events at a time. This web part is powered by the Microsoft Graph and currently requires that the Office 365 tenant be configured for targeted release for all users.
